ISAP is designed to provide increased robustness against a large class of implementation attacks on mode-level.
Implementations of ISAP hence do not require the usage of algorithmic countermeasure like masking to achieve protection against DPA attacks.
This is also why the ISAP implementations of this package follow the structure of plain (unmasked) implementations.
The document `documentation.pdf` contains a summary of ISAP's mode-level hardening/protection against implementation attacks.
