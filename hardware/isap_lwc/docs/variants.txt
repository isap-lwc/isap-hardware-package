Notation common for all variants:

Na, Nm, Nc, Nh : the number of complete blocks of associated data, plaintext, ciphertext, and hash message, respectively
Ina, Inm, Inc, Inh : binary variables equal to 1 if the last block of the respective data type is incomplete, and 0 otherwise
Bla, Blm, Blc, and Blh : the number of bytes in the incomplete block of associated data, plaintext, ciphertext, and hash message, respectively
